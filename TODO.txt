h2. Done

* make sure nobody captures a King

* incentive the promotion of Pawns

* general: improve speed (currently very slow...)

* there is a bug (computer player does not escape from Check) which I
  suppose comes from the fact that sides aren't checked properly. That
  is, I suppose it gets the wrong side, so it doesn't recognise Check
  because it looks whether the other King is under attack.

h2. To Do

* check that the user move is allowed before applying it:
** does it comply with the movement rules?
** does it move the enemy piece instead of its own?
** does it leave own King under attack?

* add support for castling

* add support for en-passant

* performance test with different hardware (memory, CPU, disks)

* test how much compacting the status can improve speed

* rewrite some routines using faster algorithms (and maybe a different
  language?)

* make sure the computer player understand the importance of check

* make sure the computer player understand the importance of checkmate
